## ✨ Description

This application was developed as part of the **final project (UAS)** for the **Back-End Programming** course.  
In this course, I received the topic **"Simple Online Forum / Message Board"**, where I was required to design and implement a forum system using **Laravel**.  

As this project was created during my **second semester**, it mainly focuses on learning fundamental **back-end development concepts** such as:
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations  
- MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture    
- Database migration and seeding  
- Authentication and route protection  
- Blade templating for frontend rendering

## 💡 Key Features

- 💬 Create and reply to discussion threads  
- 🔐 Basic user authentication (login/register)  
- ✏️ Users can manage their own posts and comments (create, edit, delete)  
- 👤 Profile management with photo upload stored in **local storage**  
- 🎨 Clean and responsive Blade-based frontend
